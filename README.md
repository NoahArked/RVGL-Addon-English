# RVGL-Addon-English
> RVGL-Addon-English is an addon to the already existing english language strings for RVGL / Re-Volt OpenGL Port. This modification is free to use. I don't own the original strings though so beware of the license as "The Unlicense" may be incorrect.

# Installation
- Download "addonenglish.txt"
- Place It In RVGL Strings Folder
- Open RVGL.exe
- Swap Language To "AddonEnglish"
- Completed!

# Download
Simply download the addonenglish.txt file and follow the installation steps listed above. This modification only works on RVGL build "Build 20.1230a"!

# Reason For This
This is a simple modification of the english strings to add a few more things to it and modify some things for my liking.
An example of a simple modification would be "Render Settings" to "Rendering Settings".
